#+title: Daniel’s Emacs Configuration

My personal Emacs Configuration, containing bits of code collected from around
the web.  Have fun with it!

* Structure

The main configuration is available in the usual [[init.el]] file, with additional
functionality distributed over files in the [[site-lisp]] directory.  Some private
data is outsources into a separate submodule named [[private]], and is not included
in this repository.  The configuration should work nevertheless, even without
these private files.
